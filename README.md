# Day-Planner


## Description
Our task was to build a basic/simple day scheduler that will save tasks to local storage on your computer machine. We also wanted to have colors change on the calandar to kind of show off and look spiffy. I had a decent time doing this one even though I am turning it in very late.

### Technologies Used
* HTML
* Bootstrap
* CSS
* JavaScript/Jquery (A lil mixture to show of my novice skill level)

## Directions
1. Open the App
2. Look at the App once opened and then look at the time
3. Click on a time block column
4. Write down a task for that hour
5. Click the save btn
6. Then refresh your comp to see that it is saved
7. Please send me a job offer because I just showed so much skill

#### ShoutOuts
In all seriousness. Shoutout massively YouTube, Stack OverFlow, Iyrna my teacher and sometimes Forrest/Tim my TA's. Not too much thanks to them honestly. JK. A lot of thanks. Also, I had a different repo this was in but I really didnt like how I did it. I fixed it up and was able to implement a lot of ES6 into the syntax since we are firther along in the course. It really helped me out on this! 

## Cheers
